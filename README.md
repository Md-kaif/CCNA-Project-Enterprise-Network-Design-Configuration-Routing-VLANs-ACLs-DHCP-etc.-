# CCNA-Project-Enterprise-Network-Design-Configuration-Routing-VLANs-ACLs-DHCP-etc.-

• Designed and deployed four separate networks (Head Office, 3-Branch Office) in Cisco Packet Tracer.

• Configured routers and switches with dynamic IP allocation using the DHCP protocol for host devices.

• Implemented multiple routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, Static, Default routes) for inter-network
  communication.
  
• Performed route redistribution to ensure seamless data transfer between networks using different protocols.

• Configured and implemented VLANs for network segmentation as well as to separate the broadcast domain and
  applied Access Control Lists (ACLs) to enhance security and control traffic flow across subnets.
  
• Verified connectivity through end-to-end ping tests, optimizing routing tables for efficiency
